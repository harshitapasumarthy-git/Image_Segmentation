<b> Introduction </b>
<p>This project demonstrates image segmentation using K-means clustering and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The segmentation process involves dividing an image into distinct regions based on the similarity of pixel characteristics. K-means clustering is employed to group pixels into segments, while HOG features help in representing the image in a way that highlights the structure and patterns.</p>

<b>Features </b>
<ul><li>Image Segmentation: Segments the image into distinct regions.</li>
<li>K-means Clustering: Groups similar pixels based on color/intensity.</li>
<li>Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Extracts features from the image to enhance segmentation quality.</li>
